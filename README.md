# Liri Bot
### Welcome to Liri: A command-line Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface!

## What can LIRI do?
LIRI can...
<li> 🎵 Search Spotify for any song title </li>
<li> 🤘🏼 Find Concerts of your favorite artist or bands </li>
<li> 🎥 Search OMDB (the Open Movie Database) for any movie title</li> 
<li> ❓ Surprise you with one of the above!  </li> 

So a better question would be, what can't LIRI do?

## Great! So how do I use LIRI?
LIRI is a command-line application built using Node.js, so you can run it in your terminal. Type one of the following commands exactly as specified below to see it in action.
<br>
#### With basicliri.js:
<li>🤘🏼 node basicliri.js concert-this 'Artist/Band name' </li> 
<li>🎵 node basicliri.js spotify-this-song 'Song Title' </li> 
<li>🎥 node basicliri.js movie-this 'Movie Title' </li> 
<li>❓ node basicliri.js do-what-it-says </li> 
<br>

#### Not User friendly?? I made it easier, with LIRI 2.0! <br>
With liribot.js:
<li>🤘🏼🎵🎥❓ node liribot.js </li> 
<li>You will be prompted to see what you would like to search! (so much easier, right?)</li>
